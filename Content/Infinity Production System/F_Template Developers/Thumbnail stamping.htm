        <h1>Thumbnail stamps</h1>
        <p>There are two forms of thumbnails that can be generated when building product templates. The first method involves using the imagestamp attribute of a layout to extract an image from a specific page of the order content PDF. The second method involves parsing a URL&#160;that extracts an image from a defined page of the PDF order content. The second option applies to thumbnails stamped on related content and additional spreads that have been created with Jaspersoft Studio. </p>
        <h2>Stamping thumbnail images using layouts</h2>
        <p>Generating thumbnails from the layout can be done by using a specific syntax for the <strong class="standOutPrimary">imagepath </strong>attribute of an image stamp. To specify the page of the PDF&#160;content to use as the thumbnail you will use the syntax shown below (taken from a layout image stamp).</p>
        <p><code>imagepath="%thumb_10080_pg2%"</code>
        </p>
        <p>The three attributes shown above between the percents signs include <strong class="standOutPrimary">thumb </strong>to designate that we are generating a thumb stamp, <strong class="standOutPrimary">10080 </strong>which denotes the product we are interested in, and <strong class="standOutPrimary">pg2</strong>, which specifies which page of the PDF&#160;the system will pull the image from. When a product has more than one component, the layout being used will determine which component the thumbnail will be generated for. </p>

                <p>Assume we are working with a book product that consists of a book and cover component. Each component defined within prebatch will have its own associated layout file. If you add the imagestamp code in the layout associated with the book, the thumbnail generated will be for the book component. If the stamp information is placed in the layout associated with the cover, the thumbnail generated will be from the cover's content.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <p>It is important to note that only a select number of pages are available for thumbnail stamping. In most situations, you will be able to stamp pages 1-5 and n-3 of the order content. </p>
        <h2>Stamping thumbnail images via URL</h2>
        <p>When building related content with Jaspersoft studio, thumbnails are generated by telling the system to pull an image from a specified location using a URL. the URL&#160;is comprised of the order id, line id, component id, and page number. To add a thumbnail to a report in Jaspersoft Studio, follow the steps shown below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Drag an image container onto the pallet where the thumbnail will be displayed</li>
            <li>Set the value of the image expression to the use the desired image</li>
        </ol>
        <p>An example of the image expression window from Jaspersoft Studio is shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assets/IPS/jasperThumbExpression.jpg" class="img thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <p>To troubleshoot thumbnail images when working with Jaspersoft Studio you can paste the URL&#160;that will be generated by the Distributed Core Processor (DCore) in a web browser to validate that the path results in the expected image. An example showing the path entered into a web browser is shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assets/IPS/jasperThumbNailTest.jpg" class="img thumbnail" />
        </p>
