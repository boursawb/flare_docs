        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>For the guided walk-through, we will use a real-world example to step through each phase of a SmartStacker integration. </p>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>You have been asked to build a new template for a 7 x 5 greeting card that will ultimately go to a SmartStacker device for finishing. The product will be imposed 12UP, consisting of 4 columns and 3 rows. The product requirements are as follows.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All measurements will be in points, where 72 points = 1"</li>
            <li>The sheet size is 2160 by 1224</li>
            <li>The full size of the imposed content is 518.4&#160;x 374.4 (7.2"&#160;x 5.2")</li>
            <li>The final trim size of the product must be 504 x 360 (5" x 7")</li>
            <li>The trimout for the product is 7.2 points on all sides (.1")</li>
            <li>A&#160;minimum distance of 4mm (11.339 points)&#160;must exist between signatures of adjacent columns and rows. If the value is less, space will need to added to the corresponding gutter to make up the difference. For example, if two adjacent signatures in column 1 and column 2 both have 7.2 points trimmed from their edges, this results in a gap of 14.4 points. This is greater than our minimum requirement of 11.339 so no additional space is required for our vertical or horizontal gutter.</li>
        </ul>
