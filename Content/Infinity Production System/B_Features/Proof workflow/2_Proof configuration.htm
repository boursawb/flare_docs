        <h1>Configuring the environment</h1>
        <p>The primary configuration that should be performed to ensure the best overall experience when working with proofs is to include the <strong class="standOutPrimary">proofNeeded </strong>attribute within the defined split by lists in the order sort configuration. Beyond that, there is no system level configuration required to use the feature. Building a UI&#160;perspective specific to creating a managing proofs will greatly improve the overall experience while using this feature. </p>
        <p>Suggestions for Proofs UI&#160;persective</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable the columns <strong>Proof, Needs Proof, Proof Sent Timestamp </strong>on the Products tab</li>
            <li>Enable the columns <strong>Proof, Needs Proof, Proof Sent Timestamp</strong> on the Sort Groups tab</li>
            <li>Enable the columns <strong>Proof, Needs Proof, Proof Sent Timestamp</strong> on the on the Batches tab</li>
            <li>Enable the columns <strong>Proof, Needs Proof, Proof Sent Timestamp</strong> and <strong>Priority </strong>on the Press Jobs tab</li>
            <li>Filter the Products, Sort Groups, Batches and Press Jobs tab by the <strong>Proof </strong>column being <strong>yes</strong></li>
            <li>Create a Quick Stat on the Products tab for <strong>Total Orders Requiring Proof</strong></li>
            <li>Create a Quick Stat on the Products tab for <strong>Total Proof Orders</strong></li>
            <li>Create a Quick Stat on the Products tab for <strong>Oldest Proof Order Timestamp</strong></li>
        </ul>
