        <p class="FirstPageOfChapter">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Output profile" />Output profiles provide a way to dynamically alter how a product will be handled as it processes through <MadCap:variable name="General.IPSshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.IPS" /><MadCap:variable name="General.CJPshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.CJP" />. This is accomplished through a process called <MadCap:keyword term="divert" />diverting, which tells the system to reprocess the selected order(s), but use a different prebatch and batch definition than was used previously. For example, you may have a product that has been configured to print on an HP&#160;Indigo press but due to required maintenance, the press is currently unavailable. In this situation, you could simply divert the work to an alternate output profile that would redirect the work to an available press. </p>
