        <h1>Working with orders</h1>
        <p> You can interact with an order by simply clicking on the row and highlighting it in the UI. Once the order is highlighted, there are several actions that can be performed using the context (right-click)&#160;menu. For detailed information about the available actions that can be performed, see <MadCap:xref href="../../A_Getting Started/2_Exploring the workspace.htm">Exploring the workspace</MadCap:xref></p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="" class="NoPageBreak">Displaying order details</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">By double-clicking an order, you can see an expanded view showing several details about the item selected. The information displayed in the details panel of the expanded row is configurable and can be customized as needed. An example of an expanded row from the products tab is shown below.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.IPS">

        </p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="">Searching for orders</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">The search field in the upper right corner of the UI&#160;provides a way to enter a string of text to find orders containing that value. When searching for orders, it is important to understand that the column including the value you are looking for must be enabled and visible, or the order will not be displayed in the results found.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Search for orders</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <ol>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">Identify the field that will be used for locating the order (customer, order id, etc.)</li>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">Ensure this column is currently enabled on the products tab</li>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">Type or paste in the value of the item being searched for</li>
                </ol>
                <p MadCap:conditions="">The UI&#160;will automatically filter down to only show rows that contain the value entered. </p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <h2>Searching for deleted order history</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">Once an order has been deleted, IPS&#160;retains history about that order for 7 days. Even though the order itself is not visible within the UI, it is still possible to retrieve the history for an order has been removed. This can be invaluable for troubleshooting that may need to occur after an order was deleted from the system. The following steps can be performed to retrieve history on an order that has been removed from the system within 7 days of the delete occurring.</p>
        <ol>
            <li MadCap:conditions="">Right-click on any order within the UI</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="">Select the option to View Order History</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="">On the order history window, clear the value currently in the text field labeled Order History Window</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="">Type in the order ID&#160;in question</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="">Click the blue refresh icon </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="">Review the history</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note" MadCap:conditions="">If no history is displayed, the order ID&#160;entered was not correct / complete or the order was deleted greater than 7 days from the time of the search.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="">Performing actions on orders</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">When working with orders, there are several actions that can be performed. To perform any of the following actions on one or multiple orders, right click on the highlighted order(s)&#160;and then select the desired action.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Mark Order Highest Priority</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p MadCap:conditions="">Marking an order with high priority (100)&#160;will result in  moving the order to the top of the queue for purposes of batching. When batches are released, they are initially ordered as defined by the sort rules in play. If a particular order currently exists in the 6th batch of a given sort group but needs to be printed immediately, the order can be marked with high priority to move it to the next batch to be released. </p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Reprocess an order</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p MadCap:conditions="">Orders can be reprocessed at various stages of the workflow. The 4 stages where a reprocess can be performed are shown below in the order of execution. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">Analyze</li>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">VDP&#160;Merge</li>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">Prebatch</li>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">Sort</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="note" MadCap:conditions="">The VDP&#160;step is only visible when variable data orders exist in the system. Additionally, there is a fifth state/light which displays in the UI&#160;for injection, but the ability to reprocess at this step does not exist and is accomplished by resubmitting the order from the order management system.</p>
                <p MadCap:conditions="">It is important to understand that when an order is reprocessed, it will move through all steps of the workflow from the point of execution. If an order is reprocessed at analyze, it will again go through the VDP, prebatch and sort steps. Conversely, if an order is reprocessed at the end of the workflow, at sort for example, it will reprocess at the sort step only. Understanding this concept is critical as it can result in duplicate work being sent to press. For example, if an operator had reprocessed an order after it had already been successfully batched and printed, the order would return to the sort groups and be available for batching a second time, ultimately resulting in duplicate work. Some of the issues that can result in needing to reprocess orders include the following.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">Configuration files for a given product have changed since the initial injection of the order</li>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">External resources were not available during the initial processing of the order resulting in a workflow step failure</li>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">System resource issues resulting in a workflow step failure</li>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">Product configuration files do not exist for a given product type</li>
                </ul>
                <p MadCap:conditions="">In general, if an order fails at some point in the workflow, you will need to reprocess the order at the failed step or before. To reprocess one or multiple orders, follow the steps shown below.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">Highlight the order(s)&#160;that need to be reprocessed</li>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="">Right-click and select the appropriate reprocess option</li>
                </ol>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p MadCap:conditions="General.IPS">Diverting orders to an alternate profile essentially takes the order and reprocesses it at the prebatch step of the workflow using a different set of product configuration files than had previously been used. For example, this can be very useful when orders originally arrived prepared for a sheet fed press but then need to be redirected to a roll fed press. The concept of diverting work essentially allows you to switch how an order will be processed on the fly.</p>

                        <p MadCap:conditions="General.IPS">Orders can be diverted from the products or sort groups tab. Diverting from products allows the operator to select one or more specific orders while diverting from sort allows for all orders within a group to be diverted at once. </p>

                <p MadCap:conditions="">Prebatch is the initial set of output generated by IPS&#160;that will be fed in to the batching process, ultimately resulting in the job that is sent to press. Think of prebatch as the initial preparation that is performed on the content received for the order. There are several functions that can occur at the prebatch step of the workflow including, sizing of content, splitting of content, adding additional content such as custom slates and banners, calculations performed against quantity, as well as several others. Selecting the option to view prebatch will open each PDF&#160;that has been generated during the prebatch phase of the workflow.. </p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:conditions="">If an application for viewing PDF&#160;files has not been installed on the system, attempting to view prebatch will result in no error or PDF&#160;being displayed. Additionally, if disk utilization has exceeded the system threshold for generating prebatch, you will not be able to view prebatch.

When deleting orders, it is important to understand that orders are at the top of the delete hierarchy and cascades down. This means that when orders are deleted from the system, they are removed from the associated batch as well. Additionally, if all orders contained within a batch are deleted, the batch will also be removed. The removal of the batch will in-turn delete all press jobs associated with the batch. </p>
