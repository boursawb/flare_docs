        <h1>Batching from sort groups</h1>
        <p>For most production environments, the majority of the time spent in the UI will be on the sort groups tab. The sort groups tab provides the main interface for releasing work to press, provides statistical information for work not yet released, allows you to change the active sort profile, and much more. There are two methods for releasing work, manual device selection and automatic device selection. When manual device selection is used, you will choose the press to submit the batch to by selecting the desired destination from the batch dialogue. When automatic device selection is used,  the job will be batched based on the current device group configuration. </p>
