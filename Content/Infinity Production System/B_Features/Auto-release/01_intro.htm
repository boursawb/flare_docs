        <h1 class="Heading1">Auto-Release</h1>
        <p>Auto-release lets you configure <MadCap:variable name="General.IPSshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.IPS" /> to submit batches of work with minimal user intervention. In most situations, operators will decide which batches are released, to what device, and when. At times, there may be a desire to use the auto-release feature to all IPS&#160;to make these decisions automatically, as work enters and processes through the system. Auto-release relies on rules that you configure to determine when a batch should be released from the system, and uses device groups to determine which device the batch should be released to. All of this can be accomplished with no interaction from the operator, once configured. In order to use auto-release, the following items must be completed..</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Any sort group that will use auto-release must have a release criteria defined</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Every release criteria has a valid matcher assigned to it</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Auto batch is enabled in the selected release criteria</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Auto Release is enabled on the sort groups tab</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">An appropriate release filter has been defined (if implemented)</li>
