        <h1>Sort rule separation</h1>
        <p>When using presort rules, the sort profile will be extended to include a section for the rules defined. For example, building out new analyze presort rules will result in a new section within the sort profile specifically intended to process these rules. Using the sort rule configuration tool, newly created presort rules can be added to the appropriate section of the sort profile by adding the rule on the appropriate tab.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Once all rules have been built and added to the appropriate section of the sort profile, orders can then be reprocessed or re-injected to validate the attributes have been updated as expected. </p>
        <p class="note">Presort rules have no affect on existing sort rules defined in the system. The exception to this would be if new sort rules have been built which utilize the presort rule attributes previously set.</p>
