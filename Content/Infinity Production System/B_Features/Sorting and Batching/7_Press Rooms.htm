        <h1>Press Rooms</h1>
        <p>Press rooms provide a way to logically organize remaining work in the system by specifying a device group on desired batch components and then associating those device groups to a press room. Once configured, you can view the total sheet and spread counts not yet batched for one or more press rooms. Press room statistics can be viewed from the Sort Groups tab by clicking the <strong class="standOutPrimary">Press Room Stats button</strong>. A typical Press Room configuration might include a press room for Books, one for Large Format, and a third for Envelopes. All products that contain the desired batch components for books would be configured to use a device group that would be added to the Book press room. All sheet and spread count data, broken down by press room, could then be viewed from the sort groups tab in <MadCap:variable name="General.IPSshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.IPS" /><MadCap:variable name="General.CJPshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.CJP" />. </p>

        </p>
        <p>The above illustration shows 3 press rooms and their associated sheet and spread counts. Checking the box next to a press room will add the sheet and spread counts to the sort group summary information displayed to the right of <strong class="standOutPrimary">Press Room Stats </strong>button. Enabling or disabling a press room has no impact on the rows displayed on the sort groups tab. Press rooms simply determine which products will be included in the overall sheet and spread count. </p>
        <h2>Key terminology</h2>
        <p>Familiarity with the following terms is recommended when working with press rooms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Estimated Spreads</b>: The number of spreads in the largest batch component (press job)&#160;across all product batches contained within a sort group. For example, if the sort group contains a 2 component batch (book block and cover) and the largest component is the book block. </li>
            <li><b>Estimated Spreads Total Batch Spreads</b>: The sum of all spreads within all product batches contained in a sort group. Essentially, the total number of spreads contained in all batches within the sort group</li>
            <li><b>Batch Component</b>: A&#160;batch component is contained within a product batch and equates to a press job</li>
            <li><b>Spread</b>: A&#160;single side of a press sheet (for simplex products)&#160;and each side of the press sheet (for duplex products)</li>
            <li><b>Sheet</b>: The entire sheet (both simplex and duplex products)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Press room overview</h2>
        <p>The following image shows three press rooms and the device groups associated with each. Given the imposition used by each batch component, <MadCap:variable name="General.IPSshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.IPS" /><MadCap:variable name="General.CJPshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.CJP" /> calculates the total number of sheets and spreads required to release the work to press.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/pressRoomOverview.png" />
        </p>
        <p>As orders complete the sorting process, batch components are inspected to determine if there is an associated device group. <MadCap:variable name="General.IPSshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.IPS" /><MadCap:variable name="General.CJPshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.CJP" /> then adds the total number of spreads within that batch component to the appropriate press room. For example, if a batch component has been configured to use the device group called <strong class="standOutPrimary">CAN24x36</strong>, the number of spreads generated by the batch component will be added to the <strong class="standOutPrimary">Large Format </strong>press room. In the event a batch component has not been configured to use a specific device group, it will resolve to the default device group for the batch component's destination type.</p>
        <h2>Creating a press room</h2>
        <p>To create a new press room, follow the steps shown below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the <code>\\&lt;masterCoreHost&gt;\idf\sharedconfig\dfe\pressroom</code></li>
            <li>Create a new <code>&lt;name&gt;.pressroom.xml</code> file (i.e. Envelope.pressroom.xml - example shown below)</li>
        </ol>
        <p><pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;pressRoom systemReservedId=""&gt;
	&lt;deviceGroups&gt;
		&lt;deviceGroup&gt;5.75 x 4.375 - ENVL&lt;/deviceGroup&gt;
		&lt;deviceGroup&gt;6 x 6 - ENVL&lt;/deviceGroup&gt;
		&lt;deviceGroup&gt;7.25 x 5.25 - ENVL&lt;/deviceGroup&gt;
	&lt;/deviceGroups&gt;
&lt;/pressRoom&gt;</code></pre>
        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Add the device groups that will be associated with this press room</li>
            <li>Save and close the file</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>IMPORTANT</b> - A&#160;device group can only exist in one press room. In the event a device group is added to multiple press rooms, only the first press room the device group is found in will be counted. It is also important to note that device group names defined in press rooms are case sensative and must match the case of the associated device group.</p>
        <h2>Working with press rooms</h2>
        <p>To display all press rooms, click the <strong class="standOutPrimary">Press Rooms Stats </strong>button at the top of the sort groups as shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/pressRoomDetails.png" title="Press room info" alt="Press room info" class="img" />
        </p>
        <p>The above illustration shows 3 defined press rooms. Books and LargeFormat both show accumulated sheet and spread counts as determined by the associated device groups. The summary information to the right of press rooms accounts for the sheet and spreads across all enabled press rooms. Disabling (removing the check mark)&#160;a press room will reduce the total spread and sheet count shown in the summary information by the amount for that press room.</p>
        <p class="note">NOTE: Specific press room selections can be saved to a UI&#160;perspective for future use.</p>
        <h2>Enabling press room columns</h2>
        <p>Press rooms can be displayed as a sort group column by performing the steps shown below..</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click on one of the columns</li>
            <li>Choose Customize columns from the menu</li>
            <li>Check the box next to each press room that should be displayed as a column on the press jobs tab</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/pressRoomColumns.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Only press rooms which contain spreads greater than 0 will display as available columns to add.</p>
        <h2>Device group to press room map</h2>
        <p>Clicking the Press Room Stats button will display a link below the last press room called <strong class="standOutPrimary">Device group to Press room map</strong>.  The press room map displays a list of all device groups defined in the system and shows which press room each device group is associated with. A&#160;blank press room column indicates that the device group has not been added to any press room. </p>
