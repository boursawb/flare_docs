        <h1>Exploring the workspace</h1>
        <p>The  user interface consists of multiple tabs. Each of these tabs represent a portion of the work flow as orders move through the system. As you become more familiar with IPS, think of the tabs like they are on a hill, with the products tab at the top of the hill and press jobs being at the bottom. This analogy will help you understand why certain things happen in the order they do.</p>
        <h2>Products Tab</h2>
        <p>The products tab is the main view for displaying orders currently in the system. The products tab allows you to search, view, filter, and sort orders to see only those you are interested in. </p>
        <p>

        <p>The context menu of the Products tab (right-click menu), consists of the following actions and categories. Expand the category to see the options available.</p>

        <p>The products tab is typically used for reviewing order information or troubleshooting issues that may arise. For generating batches and releasing work to press, this will most often be handled from the sort groups tab.</p>
        <h2>Sort Groups Tab</h2>
        <p>When it comes to the daily operations of most production environments, the vast majority of your time will be spent on the sort groups tab.  The sort groups tab provides several options for batching work to press as well as providing a very informative view for managing your current workload. Sort profiles can be used to dynamically adjusts how  batches are built to accommodate rapidly changing business needs.  Additionally, you have the ability to enable auto-release with the desired auto-release filter for quickly and efficiently releasing work to press.</p>

Jobs submitted to devices that are fully integrated with IPS&#160;will show their status as they move through press workflow. The press jobs tab also provides the ability to reprint a batch. This can be very useful when an exception batch needs only 1 or 2 of the press jobs reprinted instead of the entire set.</p>
