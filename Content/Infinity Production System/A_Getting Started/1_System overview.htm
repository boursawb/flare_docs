        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.IPSshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.IPS" /><MadCap:variable name="General.CJPshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.CJP" />&#160;sits between the order management system and the presses within the digital workflow. <MadCap:variable name="General.IPSshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.IPS" /><MadCap:variable name="General.CJPshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.CJP" /> prepares and delivers batches of client orders efficiently through production. It is important to note that  IPS&#160;is a production system, not an order system. The following illustration provides a high level overview of the  work flow.</p>

        <h2>IPS&#160;core components</h2>
        <p>The Infinity Production System (IPS)&#160;is built on the following core components.</p>
        <p><strong>Distributed Coordinator</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The Distributed Coordinator will run on one server within the production group and typically resides on the Master Core Host. This service ensures that all components defined to be in a cell are the only ones running in that cell. Additionally, the coordinator will ensure that two workers never take on the same work at the same time. For example, it is likely that a site will have the need to run both a stage and production environment. Each environment will include a distributed coordinator, one or more Distributed Core (DCore) servers and an order injector server. It is the job of the distributed coordinator to keep these environments independent and running in their own space.</p>
        <p><strong>Distributed Core Processor (DCore)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Each server will run as a Distributed Core Processor, with the exception of the database server. Among several other activities, the DCore is responsible for moving orders through the various phases of th eIPS workflow. The main workflow steps that each order will go through include inject, analyze, prebatch, sort, and batch.</p>
        <p><strong>Order injector (OI)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The order injector is the entry point for orders into the system. Standard order injection is handled by monitoring a folder where XML files (orders) can be picked up and processed. Custom plugins can be built through Infinity Professional Services that allow IPS&#160;to seamlessly integrate with third party / customer order management systems.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.IPSshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.IPS" /><MadCap:variable name="General.CJPshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.CJP" /> User Interface (UI)</p>
        <p>The user interface is the customer's view into the production workflow. From the UI, you can view order information currently in the system, identify what has been released to press and not, and view completed batches and press jobs.</p>
        <h2>Integration</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.IPSshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.IPS" /><MadCap:variable name="General.CJPshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.CJP" /> offers several points of integration into the Infinity workflow. There are two primary points of integration. The first, briefly mentioned above is the order injector. <MadCap:variable name="General.IPSshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.IPS" /><MadCap:variable name="General.CJPshortName" MadCap:conditions="General.CJP" /> also integrates with several industry digital front end devices (DFEs). The current DFE&#160;integrations standard in IPS&#160;include the following.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HP&#160;Indigo</li>
            <li>Kodak Nexpress</li>
            <li>Xeikon</li>
            <li>Xante</li>
            <li>Netgate</li>
            <li>Network hotfolder</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Jobs can also be submitted to standard network printers using the Infinity Digital OS&#160;Print Service solution.</p>
        <h2>Infinity software developers kit (SDK)</h2>
        <p>The Infinity software developer's kit provides detailed information on building an appropriately structured XML&#160;file that can be submitted to a a folder for order submission. The SDK&#160;provides a standard approach for building orders in XML&#160;format that can be generated by several industry standard tools and order management systems. </p>
